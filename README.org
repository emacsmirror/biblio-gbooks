[[https://books.google.com/][Google Books]] backend for [[https://github.com/cpitclaudel/biblio.el][biblio.el]].

The existing backends of biblio.el provide good coverage for pulling BibTeX references of peer-reviewed scientific articles, but don't have good coverage of fiction and non-fiction books. biblio-gbooks.el provides a Google Books backend for biblio.el which can pull BibTeX references directly from Google Books.
