Google Books backend for biblio.el.

The existing backends of biblio.el provide good coverage for pulling BibTeX references of peer-reviewed scientific articles, but don't have good coverage of fiction and non-fiction books. biblio-gbooks.el provides a Google Books backend for biblio.el which can pull BibTeX references directly from Google Books.

# Although no API key is necessary to use this package, it might be a good idea to get an API key if you plan on getting large numbers of BibTeX reference from Google Books.
